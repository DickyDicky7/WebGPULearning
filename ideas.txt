1. Full Multiple Importance Sampling (MIS)
1. Full Multiple Importance Sampling (MIS)

   - What it is: The current implementation uses Next Event Estimation (NEE), which is one half of MIS. A full MIS implementation intelligently combines the light from direct shadow rays (NEE) with the light found by random material-based bounces (BRDF sampling).

   - How it works: It uses a "weighting heuristic" (e.g., the power heuristic) to balance the two sampling strategies, ensuring that no light is double-counted or missed.

   - Benefit: Further reduces noise (variance), especially in scenes with complex lighting and materials. It's considered essential for a robust, physically-based path tracer.

2. Importance Sampling the Entire Skybox
2. Importance Sampling the Entire Skybox

   - What it is: Instead of treating the sun as a single special light source, this technique treats the entire HDR skybox as a massive, complex area light.
   - What it is: Instead of treating the sun as a single special light source, this technique treats the entire HDR skybox as a massive, complex area light.

   - How it works: It involves pre-processing the skybox texture to build a 2D probability distribution function (PDF). This data structure allows you to sample random directions from the sky with a probability proportional to their actual brightness.

   - Benefit: Correctly captures complex lighting and soft shadows from the entire environment, not just a single sun disc. Essential for scenes without one dominant light source.

3. Bidirectional Path Tracing (BDPT)
3. Bidirectional Path Tracing (BDPT)

   - What it is: A very powerful algorithm that traces paths from *both* the camera (like a standard path tracer) and from the light sources simultaneously.
   - What it is: A very powerful algorithm that traces paths from *both* the camera (like a standard path tracer) and from the light sources simultaneously.

   - How it works: It generates "camera paths" and "light paths" and then tries to connect their vertices in the middle of the scene.

   - Benefit: Exceptionally good at rendering difficult lighting scenarios that are nearly impossible for a standard path tracer. This includes caustics (light focusing through glass or water) and indirect lighting in enclosed spaces (e.g., light shining through a small crack into a dark room).

   - What it is: An even more advanced (and complex) algorithm, often built on top of BDPT. It is particularly good at finding and exploring very difficult, complex light paths.

   - How it works: It works by making small, random "mutations" to paths that have already been found to successfully carry light to the camera. If a mutation finds a better path, it's more likely to be kept.
